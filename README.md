### Lab Sheet 03


Objective: Understand input and output in c++.

(1) Write a program that prints following song in console window.

```c++

    Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
     How I wonder what you are.
     Up above the world so high,
     Like a diamond in the sky.

```

* [compile](http://cpp.sh/6f7b)

   
(2) Write a program that prints block letter B in 7x6 grid as follows.

```c++

*****
*        *
*        *
*****
*        *
*        *
*****

```

(3) Write a program to print following table using a single “cout” statement.

```c++

Year		Income
____		______
2001		7580.00
2002		4785.50
2003		9871.00

```

(4) Write a program that print average and total of 3 numbers given by the user.

* [compile](http://cpp.sh/7z3j)
* [source](https://github.com/samithaHewawasam/cpp/blob/master/printTotalAndAvg.cpp)

```c++

Enter 1st number ?
20
Enter 2nd number ?
30
Enter 3rd number ?
10
Total: 60
Average: 20

```

(5) Write a program that prints the sum, difference, product, quotient and remainder of two integers that are input interactively.

* [compile](http://cpp.sh/7jph)
* [source](https://github.com/samithaHewawasam/cpp/blob/master/sdpqr.cpp)

```c++

Enter first number ? 6
Enter second number ? 3
The SUM is : 9
The DIFFERENCE is : 3
The PRODUCT is : 18
The QUOTIENT is : 2

```


(6) Write a program to convert temperature from Fahrenheit degrees to Celsius degrees.
Use the equation `C = 5/9*(F-32)`, Where C is Celsius and F is Fahrenheit.


* [compile](http://cpp.sh/36bq)
* [source](https://github.com/samithaHewawasam/cpp/blob/master/fahrenheitToCelsius.cpp)

```c++

Enter Fahrenheit temperature ?
70
Celsius : 21.1111

```

(7) Write a program to input amount that a customer purchases a certain good, and the tax rate (in percentage) of the good, and calculate the total amount that the customer should pay for this good, and print the sales tax rate and the total amount customer paid.
Hint: sales tax = amount of purchased x tax rate.

* [compile](http://cpp.sh/8nmcx)
* [source](https://github.com/samithaHewawasam/cpp/blob/master/taxRate.cpp)

```c++

Please enter the price of GOOD ?
250
Please enter tax rate of GOOD ?
12
The TOTAL is: 280
The TAX is: 30

```

(8) Salesperson at a certain company gets an 8% commission on their sales. Write a program to input the amount that a person sold and output both the salesperson’s commission and the amount the company receives after the salesperson’s commission has been deducted.

* [compile](http://cpp.sh/9x2t)
* [source](https://github.com/samithaHewawasam/cpp/blob/master/commission.cpp)

```c++

Enter the amount ?
2500
Salesperson commission is: 200
Company receives amount is: 2300

```

(9) Write a program to converts mm to feet

```c++
Hint: -
25mm = 1inch
12 inch=1feet
```

* [compile](http://cpp.sh/5sef)
* [source](https://github.com/samithaHewawasam/cpp/blob/master/mmToFeet.cpp)

```c++

Enter mm ?
200
Feet: 0.666667

```
