2003		9871.00

```

(4) Write a program that print average and total of 3 numbers given by the user.

* [source](https://github.com/samithaHewawasam/cpp/blob/master/printTotalAndAvg.cpp)

(5) Write a program that prints the sum, difference, product, quotient and remainder of two integers that are input interactively.

* [compile](http://cpp.sh/7jph)
* [source](https://github.com/samithaHewawasam/cpp/blob/master/sdpqr.cpp)

```c++

Enter first number ? 6
Enter second number ? 3
The SUM is : 9
The DIFFERENCE is : 3
The PRODUCT is : 18
The QUOTIENT is : 2

```


(6) Write a program to convert temperature from Fahrenheit degrees to Celsius degrees.
Use the equation `C = 5/9*(F-32)`, Where C is Celsius and F is Fahrenheit.

(7) Write a program to input amount that a customer purchases a certain good, and the tax rate (in percentage) of the good, and calculate the total amount that the customer should pay for this good, and print the sales tax rate and the total amount customer paid.
